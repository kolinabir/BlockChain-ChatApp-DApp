# Sepolia Project

## Introduction

This repository contains the codebase for the Sepolia Project, a decentralized application built on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

   ```
   SEPOLIA_RPC_URL = "Alchemy RPC URL (SEPOLIA)"
   PRIVATE_KEY = "Your Sepolia Account Private Key"
   ```

2. Install dependencies using either `yarn` or `npm`:

   ```bash
   yarn
   # or
   npm install
   ```

3. Deploy the contract by running:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
   # or
   yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
   ```

   You will receive a contract address. Copy it and paste it in the `client/.env` file:

   ```
   VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = {Contract Address}
   ```

4. Navigate to the `./client` directory:

   ```bash
   cd ./client
   ```

5. Install client dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn
   # or
   npm install
   ```

6. Start the client application:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```
